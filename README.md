my wiki note


About the link 
==============
Link with spaces in it: >
  [[This is a link]]
or: >
  [[This is a link source|Description of the link]]

Links to directories (ending with a "/") are also supported: >
  [[/home/somebody/|Home Directory]]

Use g:vimwiki_dir_link to control the behaviour when opening directories.
